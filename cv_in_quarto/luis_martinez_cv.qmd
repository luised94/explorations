### \fullunderline{MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY (MIT)}  Cambridge, MA
**Graduate student researcher** (2016-2023)

Use of genetic and biochemical assays to understand the function of ATP hydrolysis by the origin-recognition complex during \textit{Saccharomyces cerevisiae} DNA replication.

  - Design and validation of a genetic screen for suppressors of a lethal allele of the \textit{ORC4} gene. Performed the analysis of the whole-genome sequencing data
  - Genetic characterization of the suppressor alleles through allele-specificity and drug-sensitivity experiments.
  - Biochemical characterization of an ATPase-deficient mutant ORC protein with and without the suppressor mutations.
  - CHIP-seq analysis of ORC and Mcm2-7 complex. Performed analysis of the sequencing data.
