# Overview
Convert my word-based curriculum vitae into a quarto-based document. Develop simple iteration cycle for working with quarto files.

# Goals
### Required
- Use quarto as document format for my cv instead of word
- Replicate current version using quarto
### Optional
- Adjust based on job application

## Dependencies
All of the development is done on WSL1 or WSL2 on Windows.

- quarto/1.7.31: See my_config repository for specific installation instructions.
- ttf-mscorefonts-installer: install via apt.
- Any browser? I use Brave but I dont know how using other browsers will affect this. I am sure you can just open the files in any browser to inspect.
