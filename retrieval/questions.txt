Q: Provide a brief description of the AAA+ family of proteins.
A:
The AAA+ family of proteins consists of proteins that contain domains of roughly 200 amino acids, adopting a Rossman fold.
They typically form six subunit complexes with an interface between each subunit that forms an ATPase site.
One subunit contributes highly conserved motifs named Walker A and B that are important for ATP binding and hydrolysis while the other subunit contributes the arginine finger motif which is important for ATP hydrolysis. They function in a diverse array of biological processes such as proteome homeostatis, dna replication, and organelle biogenesis.
