# Introduction

Retrieval is the most important study technique. This directory contains my attempts at building a very simple retrieval practice system. The project will be initially built with R (since I know R already) 

I would like this project to be a more comprehensive personal study but that is for the future.

# Dependencies
1. R 4.2 (I use this version because it is available in my institutions cluster.)
2. my_config repository settings and its dependencies

# Quick start
