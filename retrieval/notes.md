## Notes
### 2025-09-15
Current plan:
  Have questions in simple plain text with simple "custom" format.
  Parse with R and select subset.
  Output to console or a file. Output answer to separate file for evaluation.
  Manually add questions.

Added four questions from different fields.
Used initial format:
```format
Q:
A:
---
```

Could have format in readable form and process to csv.
