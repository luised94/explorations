"""HTTP layer -- Bottle request/response glue (D4 extraction), module http_layer.

Named http_layer (not http) because a top-level http.py shadows the stdlib http
package that bottle imports (http.client) -- the findings' S4 prototype used this
name for the same reason.

Thin route handlers over the DATABASE and LOGIC layers: each parses the request,
calls down the stack, and formats the JSON response. No business logic lives
here -- an if-statement that is not about request parsing or response formatting
belongs in LOGIC. HTTP is the top data-flow layer (config <- db <- logic <-
http); nothing imports http except main, which wires it. It is the only layer
that reads the clock (per-request timestamps handed to the DB writes).

D4a landed the request-helper preamble; D4b adds the app object, the
DATABASE_PATH request-path global, and all route handlers, so the whole HTTP
layer now lives here. DATABASE_PATH is a module global that main (drill.py)
rebinds at startup via `http_layer.DATABASE_PATH = ...`; the per-request
handlers read it from this module's namespace, so the rebind is visible to them.

Behavior-preserving: every symbol is identical to its pre-split definition.

    A pure read of the DIFFICULTY_RUNGS config: no query params, no DB, no

    table rather than re-encoding the rung set in the client -- if the table
    grows or a rung's shape changes, the selector tracks it automatically
    (the D-UI-1 decision).

    Each entry carries the rung's STRUCTURAL FACTS, not a human label: the
    server owns what rungs exist and their shape; the client composes the
    user-facing descriptor from these fields. max_result_value is the
